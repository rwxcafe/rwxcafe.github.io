      There are several options to connect to the <code>#rwx</code>
      channel. If you have an IRC client, connect to the IRC
      network <code>irc.libera.chat:6697</code> and <code>/join
      #rwx</code>. You can also join via the following web interfaces:
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        Libera chat:
        <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#rwx">#rwx</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Matrix bridge:
        <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#rwx:libera.chat">#rwx:libera.chat</a>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      You only need to join one of these links, not both. Both point
      to the same channel. If you are not an active IRC user, prefer
      joining the Matrix bridge because it is more convenient for
      someone unfamiliar with IRC. For example, you can close your
      browser or client and your chat session will still stay alive on
      the Matrix bridge. You can connect back later and read messages
      that were sent to the channel while you were away. Doing that
      with IRC requires slightly more work such as setting up IRC
      bouncers etc.

      The channel offers a channel bot named <code>rwxy</code> that
      you can utilize to carve out focus times for yourself in the
      form of timeboxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start a timebox for yourself, simply send a message like the
      following to the channel:
    </p>
    <pre><code>,b Write article about type theory</code></pre>
    <p>
      The above message contains the <code>,b</code> command that is
      recognized by the channel bot. The <code>,b</code>
      or <code>,begin</code> command begins a 30 minute timebox for
      your activity by default. After 30 minutes, when your timebox
      ends, the channel bot will notify you about it in the channel.
      If you want to start a timebox with a different time duration,
      say, 45 minutes, send a message like the following:
    </p>
    <pre><code>,b 45 Learn lambda calculus</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can also cancel a running timebox, list your completed
      timeboxes, delete a completed timebox, list all timeboxes
      running in the channel, etc. For example, the <code>,l</code>
      or <code>,list</code> command shows a list of your most recent
      10 timeboxes from the last 48 hours. Older timeboxes are
      permanently removed from the system, so they are not shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Send the message <code>,h</code>
      or <code>,help</code> to the channel to learn about all the
      commands supported by the channel bot.
    </p>
    <h2 id="enjoy">Enjoy<a href="#enjoy"></a></h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions about the channel or its activities,
      do not hesitate to post them in the channel. Most importantly,
      enjoy your stay in the channel. Grab a cup of coffee or a hot
      chocolate, start a timebox, and dive into your work with
      enthusiasm!
